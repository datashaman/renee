Josh thought this up when he started working on a new routing DSL for Goliath.
Once you combine the controller and the router, everything is easy!
Nathan did the rendering, lots of ideas and amazing documentation.
Arthur mumbles things and makes test pass. Before he makes them pass, he first makes them exist.

Oh yeah, and there is also Renee. She didn't write any of this, just keeps handing me
cups of really strong tea while I work on it. Thank you.
