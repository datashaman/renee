# Responding

## A note about bang methods

Any method that ends with ! (a bang method) will do whatever the non-bang version of that method will do,
but in addition, it will halt with that response.

## `#halt`

Halt will immediately stop processing and respond with the value passed to it. It will respond
in different ways depending on what was passed to it.

### `Symbol`

If it's a symbol, it will attempt to look it up in [`Renee::Core::Application::Responding::HTTP_CODES`](http://reneerb.com/doc/core/Renee/Core/Application/Responding.html).

    :::ruby
    # Return status with symbol
    halt :not_found

### `String`

It will use this to create a Rack::Response object and call `#finish` on it.

    :::ruby
    # Return 200 with body
    halt "hello!"

### `Array`

It will attempt to interpret this as a Rack response.

    :::ruby
    # Return 200 with body
    halt [200, {}, 'body']

### `Integer`

It will return this as a status code.
    
    :::ruby
    # Return just 200 status code
    halt 200

## `#respond` (and `#respond!`)

The `respond` command makes returning a rack response very explicit,
you can respond as if you were constructing a Rack::Response

    :::ruby
    run Renee {
      get { respond!("hello!", 403, "foo" => "bar") }
    }

or use the block DSL for convenience:

    :::ruby
    run Renee {
      get { respond! { status 403; headers :foo => "bar"; body "hello!" } }
    }

## `#redirect` (and `#redirect!`)

This will return a rack-response to the path supplied and an optional HTTP status code.

    :::ruby
    get {
      redirect!('/hello')
    }

You can also specify the status code for the redirect:

    :::ruby
    get {
      redirect!('/hello', 303)
    }

## `#render` (and `#render!`)

This will render a template based on the rendering options supplied. The simplest render is just:

    :::ruby
    render! "index"

Assuming you have a views_path setup (see [Settings](/settings)), this will render the first template named `index`.
You can also specify the template engine explicitly with:

    :::ruby
    render! "index.haml"

This will locate and render the haml template (`index.haml`) within views. You can also pass local variables to
the template:

    :::ruby
    render! "index", :locals => { :foo => "bar" }

and then access them as expected within the template. Using a layout is also as simple as specifying the
layout template with a render:

    :::ruby
    render! "index", :layout => "base"

This will render the index template within the base template in the views folder.
